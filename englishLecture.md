##### My Mindset :

# Abot Myselt -> in English :

I can't speak English very well because I'm a native Bengali speaker! In all schools and colleges of our country, all subjects are taught and explained in Bengali! But I am trying to master the English language as quickly as possible!
If you give me the opportunity to work with your team, I will adapt myself very quickly and lead your company to progress with my best efforts!

But don't judge my work skills, my speech or general behavior!
You can test me if you want, and verify my skills and qualifications!
And I hope I can satisfy you!
Insha-Allah!
