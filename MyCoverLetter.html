                There are a lot of web developer jobs out there, but I want one
                where I'll be challenged and put the skills and qualities I've
                developed to good use. I did a lot of research on your
                organization before submitting my resume/CV, and the work you
                do, the products and services you offer, and the way your
                employees support me, tell me it's a great place to work. I'm
                looking for long-term employment with the same company where I
                can really immerse myself in their brand and their online
                ambitions, and this is really the only place I want to work as a
                web developer.

              <strong># My Plan for a web development project is :</strong>
              <p class="div-p">
                There are eight basic steps I use whenever I plan a web
                development project. The planning phase is crucial to the
                success of the project. Step 1 : I will define the project goals
                and specify the objectives and budget, what we want to archive
                and when. Step Two : I will discuss and establish wireframes,
                ensuring compliance with Google's best practice guidelines,
                including how the website will function. Step Three: I will
                deploy the content that will be used during the launch and the
                content strategy will proceed. Content is king and I am keen to
                ensure that the content is fresh and more importantly, that it
                meets the needs of the end user. Step Four : I will establish
                the design and functionality of the website and these will be
                built around the wireframe and content strategy of the website.
                Step 5: I will determine the team of people involved and who I
                will use to coordinate the project. This may include the use of
                outsourcers for certain elements of the project, including
                graphics design. Step 6: I will put everything into a specific
                action plan before I start working. Step Seven: Finally step
                eight will test the website extensively across different
                browsers and mobile and desktop devices to assess its speed and
                performance before launching. Q : What will you bring to our
                company as a web developer? I will bring a quick peace of mind
                to work, which will provide in-depth technical knowledge and
                understanding of what is currently working within your industry
                from a web development perspective. I bring strong project
                management skills, team working abilities and professional web
                development and performance critical to your organization's
                success. Finally, I bring a positive mindset, the ability to fit
                into a team and an overriding passion for web development that I
                believe you will witness in the results I create for you.

At last I want to say about me and my weekness. I hope you
              consider my case and help to go ahead. I can't speak English very
              well because I'm a native Bengali speaker! In all schools and
              colleges of our country, all subjects are taught and explained in
              Bengali! But I am trying to master the English language as quickly
              as possible! If you give me the opportunity to work with your
              team, I will adapt myself very quickly and lead your company to
              progress with my best efforts! But don't judge my work skills, my
              speech or general behavior! You can test me if you want, and
              verify my skills and qualifications! And I hope I can satisfy you!
              Insha-Allah!
